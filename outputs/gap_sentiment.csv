503,Karen Ios,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM GAP,2019-11-19,1.0,"
                I paid extra to have an order I paid for arrive early, however did not receive my order. Gap did nothing except keep my money while I'm trying to get my money back since I received no products. They didn't even bother to call the shipping company to verify: they literally did nothing but keep my money! Not ethical or honest!

                Ordered 6 tee shirts online. Said they were reduced from $16.00. No way. . Quality was awful and they smelled bad to boot. Called to return and was told that EVEN IF I return these items to the store, I will pay $5.95 for restocking fee. What? I have never heard of such a thing. I have a credit card and am going to cancel it. Never again. Years ago, they provided good products. Now. Not at all. Customer service is horrible and their restocking fee is ridiculous.

508,Karan Qnt,Worst ever experience with GAP,2018-12-14,1.0,"
                Worst shopping experience with GAP! It was my first time shopping in GAP and worst ever experience. I ordered on Nov 23th, 2018. Ordered total 18 items and checked with GAP customer care on Dec 5th, 2018 for confirmation of delivery by Dec 11,2018. After waiting for delivery until Dec 13th, 2018, I called GAP customer care and came to know that UPS is returning the package to GAP and UPS tracking number is not provided to me by GAP. When I connected with UPS for package, they were looking for UPS tracking number which is not provided to me. Its really frustrating to coordinate with GAP and UPS for delivery of shipment. I have been forced to cancel the order. Never recommend anyone to use GAP products because of worst service experience!

Went to the store at qns mall 3 days they wouldn't exchange saying it was not on my c.c the store must have given me 2 carda. The bank said no you have one card. Still have no clue how many cards I have so cancelled all. They charged me more money to exchange the clothes. Their customer service was no help at all they could care less

                I went to the store to return defective pAir of pants I bought for my husband and we realised it was defective after he wore it for literally 10 mins. The associate was rude, she made fun of my accent (I Harv Asian accent) and finally when I was almost crying and about to leave, another customer behind me in line intervened and then the associate returned the pants. Poor, Poor, Poor........ Will never go to any GAP store again...you lost a very loyal customer this week.

                Yeaterday at GAP in Destin, Florida, two of the cash register ladies got in some sort of argument, dont even know what it was about. One of the ladies, Jennifer, said to a younger girl, 'You're *** doing it wrong'. At this, the younger girl, said I've had enough of this, and went to the back of the store. I just put my stuff on the neareat rack and walked out, since i was just waiting in line. I dont see why customers are exposed to this. So i have to saying rhe same the to make aurw i have enough words to complain.

                This morning i was at the gap outlet in Watertown Ma. The store opened late at 10:04 I asked the man Rodney why his reply was ""not yet'. Another customer had already walked away. I came in and I said gee that's great he said to me as he confronted me on the floor this all because he said not yet,  you have some thing to say to me and waiving his finger in my face i said don't do that. And here i was excited to use a new customer coupon. I to am in retail and when a customer is upset acting the way Rodney did made the situation worse. This is not the way to treat any customer weather nice or not. thanks, Jonathan Levens 617-272-****

                GAP don't bother to clean items from the factory. I tried on a sweater today in their HK store, over the top of my shirt, and ended up with a different colour shirt: when I took of the sweather, my shirt was covered in fluff. Shameful. You would have thought that a company the size of GAP would make an effort to present items in a reasonable condition. I asked the shop assistants for assistance and they offered my a small piece of sellotape.

517,PissedConsumer569621,Shipping takes too long!!,2014-12-13,,"
                I placed an order with Baby Gap on December 10 for items that were listed as  ""in stock"" when I placed  the order.  The order took 3 days to ship.....and only half of the items were sent; the rest back ordered!  Nothing has been received yet.  If the items are ""in stock"", I expect everything to be shipped together.  These were Christmas gifts that shouldn't take 3 weeks to receive. If I don't receive the full order by December 20th, I will tear up my account card and not shop at Gap in the future. I think you've lost a customer!!

                                Sunday I went into the Gap store to change the sizes on sweaters I purchased offline. I stood in line and was working with a sales associate on the process for returning the sweaters or exchanging them for another size.  After I picked up the sweaters the line was extremely long so I assumed I could stand on the side and wait for the representative that was working with me to complete the transaction. After standing there for 15 minutes or longer she finally looked over at me and said , oh well you have to get back in line before I can help you. I then reply to her, do you think you could have told me that a long time ago I've been standing here a long time.   I just feel like it was poor customer service and the associated could have told me that in advance. She seen me standing there waiting to be helped after 15 min or more she finally addressed me to get in line.

519,PissedConsumer510166,GAP refused to return a pair of shoe with different sizes,2014-07-14,,"
                I bought a shoe for my son couple of months back from GAP store. It was a summer shoe and my son complained after wearing that one foot was tighter and we found out that both shoes were of different sizes. One was size 13 and the other one was of size 12.  We went to get the correct size at GAP Store at Ross Park Mall Pittsburgh and that color was not available so we picked a different color in the same style and took it to the customer service and the guy refused to return it saying that this is of previous year style so he cannot exchange it. This is totally unacceptable and being a GAP customer i found this insulting in front of several other customers standing there. As it was a mistake on GAP. My wife even asked the guy that its useless for us so you can keep it and he asked us to throw it out.  I sent the complaint to GAP customer service and was someone called and got the details and tried to offer me 20% coupon. Really... I am in no mood of shopping at GAP

                                My new favorite jeans from Gap are now unwearable because the belt loop on the right side ripped off as I was pulling them on, resulting in a hols where the loop was. I actually cried when it happened I loved these jeans so much. I have been a devoted customer of the Gap for years, so this was so disappointing for me. Not only did I spend a good chunk of money on these, it is hard enough for me to find a pair of jeans that actually fit my unusual body type. Unless I am compensated for this, I will be looking elsewhere for my jeans from now on.

522,Julie P Fbb,Deceptive Practices at Gap Credit Services,2012-12-08,,"
                Gap credit services has been charging me a $35 late fee each month for the past 4 months because I've paid my bill on the 1st of the month. Apparently, their billing cycle runs from the 2nd to the 25th of each month. If you pay on the 1st, it's credited to the previous month (?) and you're assessed the $35. If you pay on the 26th, it's credited to the next month (?), and you're assessed the $35. late fee. What? Have you ever heard of such deception? Also, their online bill paying site, which I've been using to pay my bill, says nothing at all about the late fee. I found it hidden in a paper bill. They lost a good customer today, and I suggest you stay away from using their credit services as well.

                Lifelong customer of The Gap and Athleta (Gap owned).  Purchased an item at The Gap as a gift. Went on vacation. When I returned was told that the gift I purchased was not going to work. I went to return the item and was told that on a $65 pair of pants I would get $20 back becuase it had been over 30 day. I emailed them and they said  - our policy is posted at the register. Had I been told I would not have purchased the gift there - which is my suggestion for everyone else - DON'T buy your holiday gifts at The Gap. For such a big company.. .they are missing the big picture.  Lost me as a customer .. hope you will not shop there as well. Plenty other stores who value our business!

524,PissedConsumer168023,Totally PO'd customer,2010-06-18,,"
                I am currently having issues with Old Navy and their lack of information regarding shipping information being posted in the shopping cart.   I recently placed an order on Old Navy's website.  Like most americans i work during the day and no one is home for the most part so if i need things shipped i typically have them sent to my work.  i always make sure that i when i place an order on line that the shipping carrier is either UPS or FEDEX bc we have two seperate address for my placement of employment.  One is for USPS and the other is our physical address.  I have previously ordered things online with Old Navy and had no issues because things were always shipped by UPS.   Well this past or that i sent is going by USPS.  I noticed that while it was still ""in processing"" status and called customer service to either update to 2nd day shipping or to my home address to avoid having the package returned to sender.  Well this apparently is entirely too hard for them to do over there.   The first customer service rep that i spoke to told me, ""No i am sorry we can't do that because it is a security issue."" what?  how is that a security issues.  i will verify all of my personal information i just need this stuff changed because i am not going to to receive this package via usps at my work.  ""No we can't i am sorry.""  She then proceeds to tell me that what she can do is cancel the orignally order and then replace it and request 2nd day shipping.  So i say ok i'll do that.  Well as she tries to do so now a couple of the things that were ok'd by my first order are now out of stock and will not be in again.  Really?!   After i told her that i did not want to cancell the existing order because i wanted all the items that i ordered first time around, i told her that i wanted to speak to her supervisior.  i was on hold for 2o mins just for her to come back and say, ""O i am sorry but she is on the phone can she give you a call back?""  well 3 hours later i received a call back and the women is NOW telling me that they just don't have access to change the shipping information after the order is placed.  I explained to her about how there is a lack of information reguarding the shipping information and all she could do was tell me, "" I am sorry but to make up for it we will send you a 20% off coupon for your next online purchase."" REALLY ARE YOU CRAZY?!!! I am done with shopping online or in the store with GAP INC.  Their lack of care and consideration for the customers is crazy and sad.  how about saying, ""o we are very sorry for your troubles and our mistake.  How about we take care of the additional shipping charges to correct this and get your package to you""  NOPE  they just offer me 20% off knowing that i will never use it.   DON'T ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE ONLINE!!!!!!

525,MDHitchcock H,GapOnlinecom - Horrible Customer Service,2008-09-18,,"
                On Friday, September 13, 2008, we were advised that we would be getting custody of our 4-year old nephew. We have four teenaged children and no clothes from back in the day when they were this age. So I remembered I had received a coupon for Gaponline.com for 20% discount. So I went to the website and purchased $340 worth of clothes for this little boy. I received a confirmation and was told the shipment would be shipped the next business day which would be Monday, September 16, 2008. On Monday, I checked and no e-mail saying the shipment had been shipped. On Tuesday, the same so I went to GapOnline and found out that my order hadn't even been placed for shipment. I called Customer Service and spoke with a man who said it was up for shipment and would be shipped out that night. He said I should have my delivery no later than Friday, September 19, 2008. I was relieved. I checked on Wednesday and again it had not been shipped and not only that but clothing which I had ordered and was told was in stock was now no longer available, so I called again and the woman told me that first that their distribution center in Ohio had been affected by the hurricane. Then she told me that they didn't have to have my shipment delivered for 9 business days. I explained my situation and she said well then if you need the clothes that badly go to the store. I explained to her that I wanted to use the 20% discount and she said ""oh well."" I then asked her about the clothes that were now taken off my order and she said someone who ordered after me, had expedited shipping and therefore obtained the clothing that was promised to me. I don't understand this, so I said to her well can you expedite my package, I don't have a problem paying the extra fee for that. She then said due to the hurricane they are not expediting packages. I said to her you just told me you expedited the clothes I ordered to someone else. She then just said you need to go to the store, so I cancelled my order and bought the same clothes at the store and had to pay an extra $150 due to not having the coupon discount. I will never use GapOnline again. These people are rude and they don't obviously care about their customers. Customer service means nothing to GapOnline.com.

526,SteveNY,Gap horribly rude customer service,2008-08-30,,"
                I called the Gap customer service after I wanted to get a price adjustment on a piece of clothing within the 14 days they allow you to do so. The customer service woman on the phone was rude to suggest that my request for a price adjustment was outside the 14 days when in fact it was not, making it sound like she was doing a 'courtesy' favor for me for adjusting the price when I was actually entitled to it by bringing it up to them within 14 days of purchase. She also had the nerve to insist that I should call or e-mail the company within 14 days of my order. I told her I had e-mailed them within the 14 days, and that I was following up on my request by calling. She said I should have called within the 14 days to follow up. I told her that I had not gotten an e-mail reply to my adjustment request, and that 14 days had elapsed since then, and I was now calling them to follow up. She said I should have still tried to call within the 14 days. I told her that if I had written an e-mail on the 14th day, and not received a reply, I would have had no way to call within 14 days while waiting for a reply. She did not understand this point. She had a very rude and impatient temperament, and did not understand or accept the point I had made, and tried to insist I should always try to contact them as well as follow up within 14 days. Since I was getting nowhere, I asked that she simply make the price adjustment. She wouldn't let it go, and said in a whiny voice, 'I already did that, but I'm trying to tell you that you should have called us within 14 days to get the price adjustment!' What an rude, impertinent, and argumentative *** of a customer service rep. People like her should NOT annoy and badger customers with rude nonsense and actually LISTEN to the point the customers make to them. She should not have behaved like this and should not be in such a customer service position to begin with. It was a totally annoying transaction just to get a price adjustment from a holier-than-thou and argumentative Gap employee, which makes me not want to deal with purchasing from them again and have to deal with such ***. Be warned of such people at the Gap!
